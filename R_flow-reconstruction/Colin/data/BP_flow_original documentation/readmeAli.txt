Dear Helen and Colin,
 
Sincere apologies for my delay on this. I got buried underneath of 800 math sheets to mark and also I was not able to find the data I have for the BPL. I could have managed to find them late last night actually. 
 
So the Excel file attached puts together the proportional flows to the BPL from upstream locations as well as the backwater from Moose Jaw River. I start with proportional flows from the upstream of the BPL. The ungauged portions are estimated using linear regression of the nearby gauges. The period of estimation covers from January 1, 2001 to October 31, 2013. Please see the schematic of the system in the sheet called “Training”. 
 
For estimating Iskwao Creek (Y) based on Ridge Creek (X)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If cold season: Y=0.3112*(X)^0.4537
If warm season: If X=0 then Y=0; Otherwise, Y=0.4957*X+0.1185  
 
For estimating Ungauged part (U) based on Ridge Creek (X)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If cold season: U=0.01292*X^3-0.303*X^2+1.249*X-0.0956
If warm season: U=-0.05958*X^2+2.77*X-0.1463
 
Cold months include December, January, February and March and the rest of months are warm. U includes both positive and negative values. Negative values are related to the episodes, in which the ungauged instream part (including Eyebrow Lake) retain part of the water coming from upstream (i.e. diverted flow from LD as well as Iskwao and Ridge creeks). These equations were selected among a pool of 420 forms of linear and non-linear regression forms and they stand out based on Bayesian Information Criterion. Coefficient of determination (R2) for estimating the inflow to BPL stays as 0.87 during training period.
 
The sheet titled as “Backwater MJR_estimat 2001-2013” contains the estimated backwater from Moose Jaw. In this sheet the minimum and maximum backwater from Moose Jaw River is calculated using the mass balance equation at the lake, under 9 different scenarios. These scenarios are obtained based on how the water demand and flooding threshold are estimated.   
 
I have also zipped all the streamflow data I have in hand in from the upper Qu‘Apple and attached to the email. I am sure you guys have some questions. Feel free to drop me a line or call for a tele-conference if needed.
